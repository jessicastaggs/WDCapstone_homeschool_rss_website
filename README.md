# Homeschool Resource Website

-------------------------------

For my Web Development capstone project, I set out to create an all-in-one Homeschool Resource Website aimed at simplifying and enhancing the learning experience for my homeschooled children. The goal was to build a centralized hub where they could easily access their curriculum, track their attendance, monitor grades, and utilize various educational toolsâ€”all within one convenient, user-friendly platform. 

The project's current state includes a playfully styled homepage, a "Learning Tools" page featuring an interactive dictionary and unit converter tool, and a "Contact" page. Integrated features can be located by navigating to the "Learning Tools" page. 

## Integrated Features:

### Section 1 - 
    ####Use arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed in your app.
        -Used JSON object retrieved from Dictionary API to display information on site.

    ####Convert user input between two formats and display the result. 
        -Converting user input from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

### Section 2 - 
    
    ####Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.
        -Retrieved data from Dictionary API to display word, part of speech, definition, and an example sentence (if available).

## Responsive Design
-Website adapts to both desktop and mobile screen sizes.
-Best mobile viewing is on Samsung Galaxy S8+/S20 Ultra, Surface Duo, and Pixel 7.

## Utilized AI technology to assist in diagnosing broken code. 
-The styles page had an unnecessary 'period' which was preventing styles from being displayed.
-The hamburger menu responsiveness was working, but the onclick was not. I forgot to include the script tag in the HTML page.
-The dictionary search was giving errors when a correctly typed word was being searched. AI suggested to .trim the input values.
