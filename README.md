Homeschool Resource Website

For my Web Development capstone project, I set out to create an all-in-one Homeschool Resource Website aimed at simplifying and enhancing the learning experience for my homeschooled children. The goal was to build a centralized hub where they could easily access their curriculum, track their attendance, monitor grades, and utilize various educational toolsâ€”all within one convenient, user-friendly platform. 

The project's current state includes a playfully styled homepage, a "Learning Tools" page featuring an interactive dictionary and unit converter tool, and a "Contact" page. Integrated features can be located by navigating to the "Learning Tools" page. 

Integrated Features:

Section 1 - 

Use arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed in your app.
-Used JSON object retrieved from Dictionary API to display information on site.

Convert user input between two formats and display the result. 
-Converting user input from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

Section 2 - 

Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.
-Retrieved data from Dictionary API to display word, part of speech, definition, and an example sentence (if available).

Utilized AI technology to assist in diagnosing broken code. 
-CSS had a unnessary period which was preventing my styles from being displayed.
-Hamburger menu responsiveness was working but onclick was not. Forgot to include script tag on html page.
